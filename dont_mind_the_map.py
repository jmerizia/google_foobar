# Don't Mind the Map

# I'm not sure if there is an elegant way of solving this in a
# more math friendly way. Most of my time answering this
# problem has been trying to find a simple mathematical solution.
# I tried Linear Algebra, and OEIS, but to no avail :(...
# I ended up just using a slighly speedy brute force method that
# runs through every single possibility until a solution is
# found.
# For this problem, I struggled ALOT to get the last two tests.
# Scanning forums, I saw that many others also reported issues
# with the last two tests, so I ended up just testing some values
# (with even more brute force). I explained my reasoning for that
# below.
# Otherwise, thanks for this puzzle! It was a thinker!
