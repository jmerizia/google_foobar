# google_foobar
My responses to the Google FooBar problems so far. All responses that I have recorded are my own.

All of the files that do not have "TRIAL" in the filename are deployable and contain descriptive comments regarding my thought process.
The first three files are named "foo<#>" because I forgot the problems' names. All solutions use standard packages that come with a fresh installation of Python 2.7.
